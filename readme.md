This is a merkle tree based on an academic article. Merkle Tree is used in cryptography for storing and verifying hashed messages.

This merkle tree is implemented with a Red Black Tree.

This Red Black Tree stores the color inside of a node it stores the color information in a bit field.

To run the code you need to install the [crypto++](https://www.cryptopp.com/) library and use the test.sh file to run it on linux( Might need modification and needs G++ compiler)
